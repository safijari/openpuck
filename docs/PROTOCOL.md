# OpenPuck Controller Protocol

This document describes the complete controller-to-puck protocol implemented by `OpenPuck.ino`.

## 1. Scope

OpenPuck emulates the Valve Steam Controller 2 "puck" dongle. There are two separate protocols:

1. USB host-facing protocol between the puck and the computer.
2. 2.4 GHz radio protocol between the puck and the controller.

Both are required for a fully compatible implementation.

## 2. Bond record

A bond slot is 24 bytes:

```text
offset  size  meaning
0x00    4     proteus_uuid / token, little-endian
0x04    4     ibex_uuid, little-endian
0x08    16    controller serial, ASCII, not null-terminated if fully filled
```

The puck stores four independent bond slots. Slot `N` is exposed as USB HID interface `N`.

An empty slot is all zeroes.

## 3. USB protocol

### 3.1 Steam-mode USB layout

Steam mode enumerates as Valve `28DE:1304` and exposes four HID interfaces with the same report descriptor as the real puck. Each interface owns one bond slot.

Relevant report IDs:

- Input: `0x40`, `0x41`, `0x42`, `0x43`, `0x44`, `0x45`, `0x79`, `0x7B`
- Output: `0x80` to `0x89`
- Feature: `0x01`, `0x02`

### 3.2 Feature commands

Feature payload framing is:

```text
[cmd][len][payload...]
```

Implemented commands:

- `0x83`: attribute block
- `0xAE`: string attribute
- `0xB4`: connection state for the interface's slot
- `0xAD`: pairing mode enable/disable
- `0xA2`: write or clear the interface's 24-byte bond slot
- `0xA3`: read the interface's 24-byte bond slot

#### `0xB4` response

```text
[0xB4][0x01][state]
```

- `0x02`: controller connected on this slot
- `0x01`: not connected

#### `0xA2` write

`len` must be at least `24`. A zero-filled 24-byte payload clears the slot. Any non-zero valid payload writes the bond verbatim.

#### `0xA3` read

Returns:

```text
[0xA3][0x18][24-byte bond]
```

### 3.3 Host-to-controller relay

When Steam writes feature report `0x01`, OpenPuck forwards it over RF to the controller as an `E3` frame containing a SET sub-TLV:

```text
[E3][sub_len][0x05][report_id][payload...]
```

`0x05` is the confirmed SET subtype. `0x01` is the GET subtype.

This is how settings writes, haptics, and lizard-disable requests reach the controller.

## 4. Radio physical layer

OpenPuck uses Nordic raw radio mode configured to match the puck firmware:

- PHY: `Ble_2Mbit`
- Dynamic-length packet format
- `PCNF0 = 0x00030008`
- `PCNF1 = 0x01040040`
- 5-byte address (`BALEN=4`)
- Big-endian
- Whitening disabled
- CRC16, address included
- Polynomial `0x11021`
- Init `0xFFFF`

CRC is standard CRC-16-CCITT over address plus payload, MSB-first.

### 4.1 Address transform

Stored address bytes are converted to on-air address bytes by bit-reversing each byte.

For the nRF `BASE0` register, the bit-reversed base bytes are then packed big-endian:

```text
BASE0 = bitrev8(base[0]) << 24 |
        bitrev8(base[1]) << 16 |
        bitrev8(base[2]) <<  8 |
        bitrev8(base[3])

PREFIX0 = bitrev8(prefix)
```

## 5. Discovery / reconnect

Discovery uses a fixed address and fixed channel:

- Base bytes: ASCII `"ibex"` = `69 62 65 78`
- Prefix: `0x10`
- Channel: `2`

The puck transmits a host frame on that address until the controller connects.

## 6. Host frame (`E1`)

OpenPuck's discovery host frame is a dynamic-length ESB payload:

```text
RAM buffer:
[0]  = 0x12                     ; payload length
[1]  = S1 byte                  ; PID in bits 1..2, no-ack bit clear
[2]  = 0xE1                     ; host-frame opcode
[3..6]   = proteus_uuid         ; 4 bytes, little-endian
[7..10]  = ibex_uuid            ; 4 bytes, little-endian
[11]     = session channel
[12..14] = 0x00 0x00 0x00
[15..18] = session base         ; 4 bytes, stored form
[19]     = session prefix
```

Semantics:

- `proteus_uuid` is the first 4 bytes of the bond record.
- `ibex_uuid` is the next 4 bytes of the bond record.
- The host chooses the connected-session channel and address and advertises them here.

## 7. Connected session

After discovery, the puck becomes the poll master.

### 7.1 Controller wake / version frame (`E7`)

OpenPuck sends:

```text
E7 00 00
```

This is the normal "host awake" form.

### 7.2 Input poll (`E3`)

OpenPuck polls for report `0x45` using:

```text
E3 [len] 0x01 0x45 [param]
```

- `0x01`: GET subtype
- `0x45`: controller input report
- `param`: implementation tunable, usually `0x00` or `0x2D`

The controller replies in the ACK window.

### 7.3 Controller replies

Observed reply opcodes:

- `0xF1`: full TLV container carrying input data
- `0xF2`: disconnect / shutdown
- `0xF3`: status

#### `0xF1` container

The TLV scan starts at byte 6. Each record is:

```text
[len][tag][value...]
```

Known tags:

- `0x02`: 4-byte control/status field
- `0x04`: bulk data blob
- `0x06`: embedded report wrapper

For controller input, the embedded report is `0x45`.

## 8. Report `0x45` layout

Report `0x45` is 46 bytes:

```text
offset  size  meaning
0x00    1     report id = 0x45
0x01    1     sequence
0x02    4     buttons, little-endian u32
0x06    2     left trigger, u16
0x08    2     right trigger, u16
0x0A    2     left stick X, s16
0x0C    2     left stick Y, s16
0x0E    2     right stick X, s16
0x10    2     right stick Y, s16
0x12    2     left pad X, s16
0x14    2     left pad Y, s16
0x16    2     left pad press, s16
0x18    2     right pad X, s16
0x1A    2     right pad Y, s16
0x1C    2     right pad press, s16
0x1E    4     IMU timestamp, u32
0x22    2     accel X, s16
0x24    2     accel Y, s16
0x26    2     accel Z, s16
0x28    2     gyro X, s16
0x2A    2     gyro Y, s16
0x2C    2     gyro Z, s16
```

## 9. USB presentation modes

The RF side stays the same across modes. Only USB enumeration changes.

There are three switchable modes (`0=Steam 1=Xbox 2=Switch`). Steam mode is a CDC + WebUSB composite;
Xbox and Switch are **clean controller-only** devices — the auto-added CDC/WebUSB
interfaces are torn down (`clearConfiguration`) and `bcdUSB` stays `0x0200` (no USB-2.1 BOS). This is
required because Windows' `xusb` driver expects the Xbox 360 controller on the primary device/interface,
and a real Switch console rejects composite devices. Every boot/mode-switch
does a `detach -> rebuild -> attach` so the host re-reads the descriptor cleanly.

### 9.1 Steam mode

- VID:PID `28DE:1304`
- Four puck HID interfaces (CDC + WebUSB also present)
- `0x45` reports are forwarded to the connected slot's HID interface
- **Seamless lizard**: when Steam's `0x87` heartbeat is alive, `0x45` is forwarded; when it stops
  (Steam closed, 7 s watchdog) the same `0x45` is translated into mouse (`0x40`) + keyboard (`0x41`)
  reports on the **same** puck interface, so the device is a driverless desktop keyboard+mouse with no
  mode switch. This is purely USB-side; the RF poll and relay are unchanged. (There is no standalone
  lizard mode.)

### 9.2 Xbox mode

- VID:PID `045E:028E`, clean device (no CDC/WebUSB)
- Custom XInput-compatible vendor interface on `MI_00` + HID boot mouse on `MI_01` (right-pad emulation)
- `0x45` is converted into a 20-byte XInput report

### 9.3 Switch mode

- VID:PID `0F0D:0092` (HORI Pokkén Tournament Pro Pad), clean device (no CDC/WebUSB)
- Single HID interface with the canonical HORIPAD descriptor (interrupt IN + OUT endpoints), accepted by
  a real Switch console with no handshake; an 8-byte report is streamed at ~125 Hz

## 10. WebUSB control channel

The WebUSB vendor interface is present only in Steam mode (Xbox/Switch are clean controllers with no
config interface — configure them from Steam mode or switch via the back-paddle chord).

Messages:

- Host to device:
  - `0x01`: get status blob
  - `0x02 <field> <value>`: set one field
  - `0x03 <mode>`: switch mode and reboot
- Device to host:
  - `0xA5 <len> <payload>`

Status blob payload:

```text
[0]  version
[1]  usb mode
[2]  xbox mouse sensitivity divisor
[3]  xbox mouse friction
[4]  steam pad smoothing
[5]  A/B + X/Y swap
[6]  back mapping 0
[7]  back mapping 1
[8]  back mapping 2
[9]  back mapping 3
[10] connected slot or 0xFF
[11] link up flag
[12] delivered reports/s low
[13] delivered reports/s high
[14] poll interval / 100
[15] new reports/s low
[16] new reports/s high
[17] E7 mode byte
[18] relay opcode
[19] relay subtype
[20] forward-new-only flag
[21] QoS auto-hop flag
[22] persist-mode flag
```

## 11. Timing notes

- Default poll interval: `800` microseconds
- Default RX window: `1200` microseconds
- Discovery beacon continues on channel 2 even after a connected session exists
- Connected session can be moved to a cleaner channel such as 18 or 52

## 12. Reimplementation checklist

To build a compatible puck from scratch:

1. Expose four independent bond slots over USB.
2. Implement `0x83`, `0xAE`, `0xB4`, `0xAD`, `0xA2`, `0xA3`.
3. Persist 24-byte bond records exactly.
4. Configure the radio exactly as described above.
5. Beacon `E1` host frames on `"ibex"` / prefix `0x10` / channel 2.
6. Poll with `E7` then `E3 GET 0x45`.
7. Parse `F1` and unpack report `0x45`.
8. Relay host feature writes to the controller as `E3` SET sub-TLVs.
9. Re-enumerate USB cleanly when switching Steam/Xbox/Switch modes (Xbox/Switch as clean non-composite devices).

If those pieces match, the controller-to-puck protocol is fully reimplemented.
